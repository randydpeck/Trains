char APPVERSION[21] = "A-OCC Rev. 10/01/17";

// Include the following #define if we want to run the system with just the lower-level track.
#define SINGLE_LEVEL     // Comment this out for full double-level routes.  Use it for single-level route testing.

// A-OCC controls the white occupancy LEDs and RGB block LEDs on the control panel via Centipede shift registers.
// A-OCC also prompts operator for train info during registration.
// A-OCC also plays WAV files to P.A. system as trains depart and arrive at stations (autonomously.)
// A-OCC is primarily an "INPUT-ONLY" module that does not provide data to any other Arduino, except during registration.
// In Auto and Park modes, the operator can turn the rotary encoder and that will trigger A-OCC to "re-paint" the control
// panel LEDs, so that the selected train (if any, static = none) will be lit in red instead of blue.
// Control red/blue control panel block reservation and occupancy LEDs via Centipede 1 (address 0.)
// Control white control panel occupancy-indication LEDs via Centipede 2 (address 1.)
// Listens for RS485 commands from A-SNS to A-MAS to track occupancy sensor status (just like A-MAS does.)
// Listens for RS485 commands from A-MAS to A-LEG to track route reservations (and release based on A-SNS messages.)
// Communicates bidirectionally via RS485 with A-MAS during Registration, to prompt operator for starting train locations.
// BLUE AND RED BLOCK OCCUPANCY/RESERVATION LEDS:
// Since blue blends into the background, and red stands out, we'll want to use red to emphasize something.
// In MANUAL and POV mode, *all* occupied blocks will display a SOLID BLUE LED.
// In REGISTER mode, all occupied blocks except the one being identified (by train name/number) will be SOLID BLUE,
//   and the train at the block being identified (prompted) will be BLINKING RED.  No need for the operator to know/see
//   which occupied blocks have/haven't been ID'd yet, because we won't stop prompting until all have been ID'd.
// In AUTO and PARK mode, all non-selected (by rotary encoder to ID train name/number) blocks will be BLUE.
//   Non-selected reserved routes will be SOLID BLUE, and the block(s) with the train in it (the tail) will be BLINKING BLUE.
//   The selected (by rotary encoder to ID the train name/number) train's reserved route will be SOLID RED, and the block(s)
//   with the selected train in it (the tail) will be BLINKING RED.

// IMPORTANT: A-MAS really needs to send PA commands to A-OCC, rather than letting A-OCC decide, because A-MAS should tell A-OCC to make
// an announcement i.e. departing well BEFORE the train starts moving out.  How would A-OCC know when this would be?  Unless we want A-MAS
// to send DELAYED DEPARTURE commands to A-LEG that A-OCC would see...  Thus A-OCC could make the announcement as soon as it sees that
// A-MAS has told A-LEG to depart...  But that would result in possibly unnecessary delays that A-MAS would need to impose, even when
// A-OCC might not make an announcement for that train, for whatever reason...

// 09/16/17: Changed variable suffixes from Length to Len, No/Number to Num, Record to Rec, etc.
// 02/26/17: Added mode and state changed = false at top of get RS485 message main loop
// STILL TO BE DONE:
//   Add code for AUTO and PARK mode that illuminates control panel occupancy and block LEDs as appropriate.  This will
//     require us to maintain a Train Progress table and monitor train route commands from A-MAS to A-LEG, including
//     block reservations per the Route Reservation (and Park 1, Park 2) table.
//   Add code to manage the P.A. Announcement system, when running in Auto mode (and optionally Park mode.)
// 02/25/17: Adding Rotary Encoder logic to prompt operator, with 8-char A/N display.
// 01/21/17: Adding registration code.
// 01/13/17: Added a few pin numbers i.e. rotary encoder and other misc as we work towards completing this code.
// 11/11/16: Update code to reflect that in MANUAL, POV, and REGISTER modes, there is no STOPPING state.
// Go directly from RUNNING to STOPPED.  No point in STOPPING.
// 11/10/16. Initial version.

// DESCRIPTION OF CIRCULAR BUFFERS Rev: 9/5/17.
// We use CLOCKWISE circular buffers, and tracks HEAD, TAIL, and COUNT.
// HEAD always points to the UNUSED cell where the next new element will be inserted (enqueued), UNLESS the queue is full,
// in which case head points to tail and new data cannot be added until the tail data is dequeued.
// TAIL always points to the last active element, UNLESS the queue is empty, in which case it points to garbage.
// COUNT is the total number of active elements, which can range from zero to the size of the buffer.
// Initialize head, tail, and count to zero.
// To enqueue an element, if array is not full, insert data at HEAD, then increment both HEAD and COUNT.
// To dequeue an element, if array is not empty, read data at TAIL, then increment TAIL and decrement COUNT.
// Always incrment HEAD and TAIL pointers using MODULO addition, based on the size of the array.
// Note that HEAD == TAIL *both* when the buffer is empty and when full, so we use COUNT as the test for full/empty status.

// TRAIN PROGRESS STRUCTURE Rev: 9/5/17.
// An array of a structures.  Each structure represents the active route of a single train, and contains a circular buffer head, tail,
// and count (number of active records), as well as an array of about a dozen blocks, which includes Block Number, Entry Sensor, and
// Exit Sensor numbers.  There is one element of the structure array for each train -- so about 8 structure array elements.
// Each record represents a reserved block that is part of the train's current reserved route.
// New records are added when a train is first registered (just a single block) and when new routes are added (multiple blocks.)
// Old records are "cleared" as the train progresses along its route, based on exit sensors clearing.
// The blocks in the Block Reservation table are closely tied to these records -- when new records are added to Train Progress, the
// corresponding blocks are reserved in the Block Reservation table; and when Train Progress exit sensor records are cleared (i.e. when
// a block is released/dequeued), the corresponding blocks are "un-reserved" in the Block Reservation table.
// Similarly, every active record in the Train Progress table must have exactly one "reserved" record in the Block Reservation table.
// We might want to run a periodic function that confirms that the number of active Train Progress records (sum of the "length" for all trains)
// is equal to the number of records flagged as "Reserved" in the Block Reservation table.  Fatal error if they are ever not the same.
// When the table is initialized (with no train), head == tail == 0, and length == 0.
// When a new train is first established, it will have just a single record where head == tail == 0, and length = 1.
// As a route is added, records will be added at the head and then head and length will be incremented.
// As the train clears blocks, they will be "un-reserved" and the tail will be incremented and the length will be decrimented.
// trainProgress does not keep track of the actual location of the train; only that the train has those blocks reserved, and
// the train is guaranteed to be somewhere within that route -- not necessarily at the head or the tail.
// The code will watch the sensors being tripped and cleared, and infer the location of each train to be at, or just beyond (if the train
// is moving), the tripped sensor which is closest to the head.
// When we receive a sensor status change, we must be CERTAIN that we find it in the Train Progress talbe, otherwise it's a fatal error!

// DEBUG NOTE: It will be easy to provide debug code to the serial monitor that shows a "picture" of an entire array -- each reserved
// block, including entry and exit sensor, and the status (tripped or cleared), updated each time something happens.
// Perhaps we can show a list of sensos tripped and cleared separately from the linear "map" of the route.
// (In this context, "route" does not necessarily correspond exactly with a specific "route table" route, but rather all or a portion of
// one or two specific routes (the portion(s) reserved for this train,) or even just a single block when a train is first registered.

// WITH REGARDS TO A-OCC: Painting the red/blue and white occupancy sensor LEDs:  If we update the train progress table every time a sensor
// status changes, we will have enough information to paint the control panel red/blue and white LEDs.
// We will pass a parm to the paint routine "train number selected" and paint that red, if any.

  // which indicates if each LED should be off, on, or blinking.
  // But first, check a timer to be sure that we don't update our turnoutPosition[] array too frequently -- only about
  // as quickly as the actual turnouts are processed by A-SWT.  This is NOT related to the LED flash rate or refresh rate.
  // Note that this function does NOT actually illuminate or darken the green control panel LEDs.
  // We use a 32-char array to maintain the current state of each turnout:

      // 1: Update turnoutPosition[0..31] for the turnout that was just "thrown."  So we have a list of all current positions.
      // 2: Update turnoutLEDStatus[0..63] to indicate how every green LED *should* now look, with conflicts resolved.

      // For example, we might update turnoutPosition[7] = 'R' to indicate turnout #7 is now in Reverse orientation
      turnoutPosition[turnoutNumSingle - 1] = turnoutCmdSingle;  // 'R' and 'N' are the only valid possibilities

      // Now that we have revised our "turnoutPosition[0..31] = N or R" array, we should fully re-populate our turnoutLEDStatus[] array
      // that indicates which green turnout LEDs should be on, off, or blinking -- taking into account "conflicts."
      // There are 8 special cases, where we have an LED that is shared by two turnouts.  If the LED should bit lit based
      // on one of the pair, but off according to the other turnout, then the shared LED should be blinking.
      // This means that if two facing turnouts, that share an LED, are aligned with each other, then the LED will be solid.
      // If those two turnouts are BOTH aligned away from each other, then the LED will be dark.
      // Finally if one, but not both, turnout is aligned with the other, then the LED will blink.

      // First update the "lit" status of the newly-acquired turnout LED(s) to illuminate Normal or Revers, and turn off it's opposite.
      // This is done via the turnoutLEDStatus[0..63] array, where each element represents an LED, NOT A TURNOUT NUMBER.
      // The offset to the LED number into the turnoutLEDStatus[0..63] array is found in the LEDNormal[0..31] and LEDReverse[0..31] arrays,
      // which are defined as constant byte arrays at the top of the code.
      // I.e. suppose we just read Turnout #7 is now set to Reverse:
      // Look up LEDNormal[6] (turnout #7) =  Centipede shift register pin 6, and LEDReverse[6] (also turnout #7) = Centipede pin 22.
      // So we will want to set LED #6 (7N) off (turnoutLEDStatus[6] = 0), and set LED #22 (7R) on (turnoutLEDStatus[22] = 1).
      // For simplicity, and since this is all that this Arduino does, we'll re-populate the entire turnoutLEDStatus[] array every time
      // we pass through this block -- i.e. every time a turnout changes its orientation.
      // Then we will address any conflicts that should be resolved (facing turnouts that are misaligned.)

      // 1N = Centipede output 0      1R = Centipede output 16
