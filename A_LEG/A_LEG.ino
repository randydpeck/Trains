// Include the following #define if we want to run the system with just the lower-level track.  Comment out to create records for both levels of track.
#define SINGLE_LEVEL     // Comment this out for full double-level routes.  Use it for single-level route testing.

// Include the following #define if we want to populate the Delayed Action table with some test data, versus initializing empty.
#define TEST_DATA        // Comment this out for non-test scenario, normal version.

// Need to re-write (maybe) Legacy command buffer (circular buffer similar to turnout buffer?)
// Need to re-write Train Progress table from array to structure, and revise circular buffer logic.
// Need to revise some inline code to functions.
// Need to consider sending some parameters to functions by reference (other than globals.)
// GOOD IDEA: If smoke is on, how about a command to turn OFF smoke on all locos if they have been running for more than 10 minutes?



// 09/16/17: Changed variable suffixes from Length to Len, No/Number to Num, Record to Rec, etc.
// 02/29/17: Adding logic for Auto mode, and populating and processing Delayed Action and Train Progress tables.
// 02/26/17: Added mode and state changed = false at top of get RS485 message main loop
// 02/25/17: Adding code to watch Registration messages between A-MAS and A-OCC, and act accordingly.

// NOTE: We *do* care about Mode Change messages from A-MAS: Entering Registration mode, we need to clear out Train Progress and Delayed
// action tables.  And although we always track sensor changes, if we are not in Auto or Park mode, we will not scan the Train Progress
// or Delayed Action tables when sensor changes are received.
// When we receive RS485 route commands from A-MAS, we will see if they are regular 'R'oute, or Park 1, or Park 2.  So we will need some special
// logic for Park 2 to insert "put loco in reverse" and also ignore sensor 36, and set predetermined speed (maybe loco "slow") versus regular
// speed for Block 9 (which we won't see anyway since it's not listed in the Park 2 table.)
// Hopefully, A-MAS won't send us a Park 1 command, or even stop Auto mode, until it sees that all trains have completed their Auto mode and cleared
// all sensors except destination exit sensor (i.e. presumably they are all stopped.)
// A-MAS will allow operator to press the Stop button in Auto mode, but will not illuminate the Start button for Park mode until all Auto trains
// have completed their routes.
// A-LEG can assume that if it receives a Park 1 route, that all Auto trains have stopped and Train Progress shows only one block/train.
// If the operator needs to stop trains abnormally, he can push Halt or use the control panel PowerMaster off switches, which are always monitored.
// Duties of A-LEG:
// 1. Monitor the Halt line and send an immediate Emergency Stop command to Legacy if pulled low (regardless of mode.)
// 2. Monitor the control panel PowerMaster toggle switches and turn them on and off if operator moves one of them (regardless of mode.)
// 3. Monitor the RS485 bus for MODE CHANGE or STATE CHANGE commands from A-MAS.  
//      When REGISTER mode is started, we should clear out the Train Progress and Delayed Action tables, as well as the Sensor
//      Status and Block Reservation tables, if that is relevant here (Not sure).  i.e. reset everything.
// 4. Watch for RS485 commands from A-MAS during Registration, including SMOKE Y/N, and STARTUP FAST/SLOW.
// 5. Watch for RS485 commands from A-MAS (or A-OCC to A-MAS, haven't decided as of 9/27/17) during Registration for TRAIN REGISTERED.
//      As each train is registered, A-LEG will create a new initial record in the Train Progress table for that train, turn smoke on or off,
//      and run the startup sequence.
// The following Train Control duties are only going to happen when in Auto or Park mode:
// 6. Watch for RS485 New Route commands from A-MAS.  This will include a Train Num. (1 thru 10) and a Route Num. (Regular, or Park 1 or Park 2.)
//    A-MAS implies okay to proceed with a train when it sends a route; A-LEG can decide if it should wait a bit, or not.
//    When a new route is identified, populate the Delayed Action table with a set of Timed records to make announcements, blow whistle, start train,
//    etc., and also a set of Sensor records to be executed as the train moves along the route.
// 7. Watch for RS485 Sensor Change messages from A-SNS.
//    In AUTO and PARK modes, when a sensor-change message is received, immediately scan Delayed Action for relevant records, do whatever is
//    indicated there.  This could be, for instance, turn off sound when entering a tunnel, start or stop a crossing signal, etc.
//    If the sensor-change is a Destination Entry or Destination Exit, run code to populate the Delayed Action table with commands to slow train, turn
//    on bell, stop the train, etc.  We don't populate the Delayed Action table with ANY commands for the destination block at the time that we populate
//    to start or continue a route, because we won't know until later if we might get a "continue on with another route" command from A-MAS before we
//    start to slow down -- so we may never need to execute slow-and-stop commands for the original destination siding.
// 8. Scan the Delayed Action table (in FRAM2) looking for records that are "ripe" based on time, or when a sensor event has occurred.
//    When Delayed Action table records are found that need to be executed, they will be inserted into the Legacy Command buffer.
// 9. Check for any commands in the Legacy Command buffer, and execute them as soon as possible.

// Here are the data and types of commands that we will need to know about:
//   Device Type(1 char) (Engine, Train, Accessory, Switch, Route [E|T|A|S|R]
//   Device Num (1 byte) (engine, train, accessory, switch, or route number)[0..99]
//     NOTE: We may implement Switch and Route commands here if we want to support Parking trains including backing into a siding.
//     Should actually be pretty straightforward to implement but we need other Arduinos involved.
//   Command Type(1 char)[E | A | M | S | B | D | F | C | T | Y | W | R]
//     E = Emergency Stop All Devices(FE FF FF) (Note : all other parms in command are moot so ignore them)
//     A = Absolute Speed command
//     M = Momentum 0..7
//     S = Stop Immediate(this engine / train only)
//     B = Basic 3 - byte Legacy command(always AAAA AAA1 XXXX XXXX)
//     D = Railsounds Dialogue(9 - byte Legacy extended command)
//     F = Railsounds Effect(9 - byte Legacy extended command)
//     C = Effect Control(9 - byte Legacy extended command)
//     T = TMCC command
//     Y = Accessory.  Parm 1 will be 0=off, 1=on       (Custom relay board; not sent to Legacy/TMCC)
//     W = Switch.  Parm 1 will be 0=Normal, 1=Reverse  (UNUSED in any foreseeable version)
//     R = Route.  Parm 1 will be route number to set.  (UNUSED in any foreseeable version)
//   Command Parameter (1 byte) (speed, momentum, etc., or hex value from Legacy protocol tables)
// PowerMasters are controlled by addressing their Engine Num. and setting their Abs Speed to 1 (on) or 0 (off.)

// (Comments from loop() code below...
// We need to watch for the following RS485 messages:
//   In ANY mode:
//     From A-MAS to ALL broadcasting change of mode and state (i.e. Register Mode, Running)
//     From A-SNS to A-MAS reporting a sensor status change.
//   In REGISTER mode, RUNNING state:  IMPORTANT: Sensor status MUST NOT change during Registration, all trains must be stopped!
//       We can add logic to check before-and-after status of every sensor, but for now we'll just assume that we don't want to crash the program.
//     From A-OCC to A-MAS certain replies from the operator via a/n display.  i.e. SMOKE Y/N, STARTUP FAST/SLOW.
//     From A-OCC to A-MAS replies with operator registration data.  A-LEG should establish a fresh Train Progress record and startup the loco.
//   In AUTO or PARK mode, RUNNING or STOPPING state:
//     From A-MAS to A-LEG assigning a new route (or Park 1 or Park 2?) to a train (will not occur if state = STOPPING)
//     From A-MAS to ALL, changing state to STOPPING -- probably nothing special to do until another mode started.
//     From A-MAS to ALL, changing state to STOPPED -- continue to maintain Train Progress in case we start Auto again???
//       NOTE: A-LEG does not care about block reservations, so nothing to do there -- but we do use the table for reference to block data.

// DESCRIPTION OF CIRCULAR BUFFERS Rev: 9/5/17.
// We use CLOCKWISE circular buffers, and tracks HEAD, TAIL, and COUNT.
// HEAD always points to the UNUSED cell where the next new element will be inserted (enqueued), UNLESS the queue is full,
// in which case head points to tail and new data cannot be added until the tail data is dequeued.
// TAIL always points to the last active element, UNLESS the queue is empty, in which case it points to garbage.
// COUNT is the total number of active elements, which can range from zero to the size of the buffer.
// Initialize head, tail, and count to zero.
// To enqueue an element, if array is not full, insert data at HEAD, then increment both HEAD and COUNT.
// To dequeue an element, if array is not empty, read data at TAIL, then increment TAIL and decrement COUNT.
// Always incrment HEAD and TAIL pointers using MODULO addition, based on the size of the array.
// Note that HEAD == TAIL *both* when the buffer is empty and when full, so we use COUNT as the test for full/empty status.

// TRAIN PROGRESS STRUCTURE Rev: 9/5/17.
// An array of a structures.  Each structure represents the active route of a single train, and contains a circular buffer head, tail,
// and count (number of active records), as well as an array of about a dozen blocks, which includes Block Number, Entry Sensor, and
// Exit Sensor numbers.  There is one element of the structure array for each train -- so about 8 structure array elements.
// Each record represents a reserved block that is part of the train's current reserved route.
// New records are added when a train is first registered (just a single block) and when new routes are added (multiple blocks.)
// Old records are "cleared" as the train progresses along its route, based on exit sensors clearing.
// The blocks in the Block Reservation table are closely tied to these records -- when new records are added to Train Progress, the
// corresponding blocks are reserved in the Block Reservation table; and when Train Progress exit sensor records are cleared (i.e. when
// a block is released/dequeued), the corresponding blocks are "un-reserved" in the Block Reservation table.
// Similarly, every active record in the Train Progress table must have exactly one "reserved" record in the Block Reservation table.
// We might want to run a periodic function that confirms that the number of active Train Progress records (sum of the "length" for all trains)
// is equal to the number of records flagged as "Reserved" in the Block Reservation table.  Fatal error if they are ever not the same.
// When the table is initialized (with no train), head == tail == 0, and length == 0.
// When a new train is first established, it will have just a single record where head == tail == 0, and length = 1.
// As a route is added, records will be added at the head and then head and length will be incremented.
// As the train clears blocks, they will be "un-reserved" and the tail will be incremented and the length will be decrimented.
// trainProgress does not keep track of the actual location of the train; only that the train has those blocks reserved, and
// the train is guaranteed to be somewhere within that route -- not necessarily at the head or the tail.
// The code will watch the sensors being tripped and cleared, and infer the location of each train to be at, or just beyond (if the train
// is moving), the tripped sensor which is closest to the head.
// When we receive a sensor status change, we must be CERTAIN that we find it in the Train Progress talbe, otherwise it's a fatal error!

// DEBUG NOTE: It will be easy to provide debug code to the serial monitor that shows a "picture" of an entire array -- each reserved
// block, including entry and exit sensor, and the status (tripped or cleared), updated each time something happens.
// Perhaps we can show a list of sensos tripped and cleared separately from the linear "map" of the route.
// (In this context, "route" does not necessarily correspond exactly with a specific "route table" route, but rather all or a portion of
// one or two specific routes (the portion(s) reserved for this train,) or even just a single block when a train is first registered.

// WITH REGARDS TO A-OCC: Painting the red/blue and white occupancy sensor LEDs:  If we update the train progress table every time a sensor
// status changes, we will have enough information to paint the control panel red/blue and white LEDs.
// We will pass a parm to the paint routine "train number selected" and paint that red, if any.

  // If this is an EXPIRED record, then just move on to the next record.

  // If this is an ACTIVE, TIMED record that is RIPE, the UPDATE the record as Expired, and EXECUTE the command (train speed, etc.)
  // When we get a "sensor status change" message from A-SNS, we'll scan the Delayed Action table to see if there are any action(s) that we
  //   need to take based on that.  Note that we could have MORE THAN ONE record for a given sensor change, so we need to do this in a loop
  //   that scans the table until we make it to the end without any "Sensor" record hits.
  // Note that we exit the loop as soon as we find a ripe record, always starting at the beginning.






  byte actionRecFound = false;     // Set this to true if we find a record in the following table scan

  // IMPORANT: We eventually need to change the following for.. loop to not scan the entire table, but only the highest active record.
  // We defined a variable for this above, highestValidDelayedActionRec = 0, be we need to establish a value as we populate the table
  // and as we add records (if they must be added to the top of the table rather than an expired slot.)



  // IMPORTANT 1/20/17: The following needs to be broken into two separate functions:
  // getActionTableTimerElement, which searches and returns a ripe record if one is found.  If it's the last record, maybe also decrements last-record variable.
  // getActionTableSensorElement, which searches and returns a record that matches the sensor number and type (trip/clear).
  //   This latter must be in a repeat loop to run until no further records are found, because there could be several commands to run on a given
  //   sensor trip or clear.  And unlike timer records, where we just run from time to time to see what's there, the sensor searches must be run
  //   at the time a sensor change record is received, and all matching records for that sensor+type need to be executed.  There can be zero or more.
  // Special logic needed when we trip the destination entry and destination exit sensors.  Just look at the train progress table to determine if
  // that is the case.
  
  // When we get a new sensor change record from A-SNS, the first thing we need to do is see if it is a DESTINATION SIDING ENTRY SENSOR TRIP
  // for any active train.  When that happens, we need to populate Delayed Action with the whole sequence of "come to a stop" commands including
  // destination exit sensor trip commands.  There may or may not already be Delayed Action record(s) for dest siding, maybe turn on acc'y?
  
  // When we get a new sensor change record from A-SNS that is not a destination siding entry sensor trip, then we must search the Train Progress table
  // to see which train and confirm it's moving as expected i.e. tripping and clearing in order.  Then search Delayed Action for any matches.
  // We may need to allow for CLEARING (but not tripping) slightly out of order, because we could have a longer delay on a relay that caused an earlier
  // release to not show up until after a "later" release just due to the relay time delay.
  
  // When we get a New Route+Train command from A-MAS, we first check the Train Progress table to see if the train has entered the destination siding yet.
  // If so, then we will have already created the set of records to bring the train to a stop.
  // If it has NOT yet entered the destination siding, then we just add continuation records starting with the "old" destination siding.
  // Special case if this is the first time the train has been assigned a route...Train Progress length will be zero so we'll know it, and can handle appropriately.
  
  // When we get a New Route+Train record from A-MAS, we populate train progress with start thru end (potentially extending a route) but the
  // Delayed Action table gets different records depending if the train is moving (i.e. extending a route) to stopped (starting as if new.)
  // If moving, then we start by making an entry for the first block int he route, which is the destingation block for the previous route this train
  // had -- with momentum and speed for this block as a "through" block, plus any other special commands that might be relevant for this block.
  // If stopped, we populate the whole "make announcement and get moving" sequence.
  // But we ALWAYS refrain from any Delayed Action records for the destination block entry or exit sensor as those must be created at the time
  // the destination entry sensor is tripped, because we won't know for sure until then if it's a continuation route, or from a stop.
  
  // When we create a new set of Delayed Action records for a new route, we may eventually need a new table for "Block Actions" that is a lookup for what
  // actions to insert in Delayed Action for a given block, perhaps also other parameters such as loco type etc.  I.e. when entering block 13 eastbound,
  // always turn off sound.  And wen entering 8 eastbound, always turn ON sound.  (Block 21 is a bit tricky with sound because some in and some out of tunnel.)
