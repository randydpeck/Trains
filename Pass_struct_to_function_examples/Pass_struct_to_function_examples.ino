// Rev: 08-17-17 by RDP.  Proof of concept for passing structures to functions.
// Passing a STRUCT item (not part of an array) to a function.  We must pass functions a pointer to the struct item.
//   This will permit the function to modify the contents of the struct item.
// Passing an array of STRUCT to a function.  Since the name of the array is synonomous with the address, we can pass just the name.

  // To pass a single STRUCT variable (not part of an array), we need to pass the address...

  // Now print again and we should see 888 to prove that the function modified part of the struct

  // Now pass the entire STRUCT array.  This is equivalent to passing the address/pointer.

  // Now print again and we should see 999 to prove that the function modified part of the struct.

  // See "C Primer Plus" page 622.
  // testBody is our local name for singleBody
  // Because testBody is a pointer (the address of the original struct) and not a structure, we use
  // the "->" operator instead of the dot operator.  i.e. testBody->p[0] rather than testBody.p[0].

// int printBodies(struct body tbodies[], int NUMBODIES) {    // Identical to the following

  // Because an array name (without brackets) is the same as the address of the first element of the array, and this is an
  // array of struct body, you can use "struct body tbodies[]" and "struct body * tbodies" interchangably.
  // See "C Primer Plus" page 402 and 637.
  // tbodies[] is our local name for bodies[]
  // Because tbodies[] is a structure (not a pointer) we can use the dot operator i.e. tbodies[1].p[2] rather than the "->" operator.
  // NUMBODIES is a global constant so not really needed to pass.
  // "Just as you can use pointer notation with array names, you can use array notation with a pointer."  I think this is why
  // we don't need to use the "->" operator.
  // The array is an array of structures, not an array of pointers, so once you select a particular structure
  // with [n] there is no need to further dereference it.
  // NOTE 8/19/17: Despite the above descriptions (taken from book and websites) I still don't really understand why you need
  // to use the de-reference "->" when you pass a pointer to an individual struct, but you can use the dot operator if you're
  // passing (a pointer to) an ARRAY of struct.
  // NOTE: If we did not want the function to modify any part of the structure, we could use the "const" keyword:
  // int printBodies(const struct body tbodies[], int NUMBODIES) {
  // object.member
  // pointer->member
